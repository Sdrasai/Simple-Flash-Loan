# Simple Flash Loan Project

This project demonstrates how to create a simple flash loan contract using the Aave protocol on the Sepolia Ethereum testnet. 

## Overview

Flash loans are a type of uncollateralized loan that must be borrowed and repaid within the same transaction. They are primarily used for arbitrage, collateral swaps, and other advanced trading strategies. This project utilizes Aave's flash loan feature to perform such operations.

- NPM or Yarn
- Hardhat
- An Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask)
